- 👋 Hi, I’m @ASUHacker
- 👀 In addition to cybersecurity, I’m particularly interested in languages (Japanese, Russian, French, German, Chinese, maybe some Spanish, Arabic, and Korean this year), martial arts, guitar/songwriting, AI (use and security), and technology in general
- 🌱 Always learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything you think I can help with.
